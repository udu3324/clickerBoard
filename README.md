# clickerBoard
**"clickerBoard"** is a program to have fun with, or measure your clicks. It's a simple strategic game, get the most clicks! There are settings and things you can mess with as long as it does not give you a BSOD or brick your PC. New features and other things will be added in the upcoming future, its mostly unexpected unless if you get status updates via my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KEeWV9h).
